# Extra Reading

There are two excellent resources for further reading on Rust's
macro system:

 - [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros.html),
 - [The Little Book of Rust Macros](https://veykril.github.io/tlborm/) (note
   that an older version exists, so make sure you're reading this up-to-date one!)
