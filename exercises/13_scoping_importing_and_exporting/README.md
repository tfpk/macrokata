The subject of scoping, importing and exporting are well covered
by the [Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html#scoping-exporting-and-importing).

While practical examples of these may be useful, this first verison of `macrokata` does not
include exercises for them. If you plan on using macros in a larger project, we suggest reading
the above reference.
