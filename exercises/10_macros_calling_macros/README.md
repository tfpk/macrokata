# Exercise 10: Macros Calling Macros

We briefly mentioned in a previous exercise that macros are able to call
other macros. In this exercise we will look at a brief example of that.
Before we do, there are three small notes we should mention.

## The `stringify` macro

The `stringify!` macro takes tokens and turns them into a `&str` that
textually represents what those tokens are. For example, `stringify!(1 + 1)`
will become `"1 + 1"`.

## The `tt` fragment specifier

An important macro specifier which we have not, as of yet, discussed,
is the `tt` macro. This captures a "Token Tree", which is any token,
or a group of tokens inside brackets. This is the most flexible
fragment specifier, because it imposes no meaning on what the captured
tokens might be. For example:

``` rust
macro_rules! stringify_number {
    (one) => {"1"};
    (two) => {"2"};
    ($tokens:tt) => { stringify!($tokens)};
}

# fn main() {
stringify_number!(one); // is "1"
stringify_number!(while); // is "while"
stringify_number!(bing_bang_boom); // is "bing_bang_boom"
# }
```

It's really important to keep in mind with `tt` macros that you **must**
ensure that anything after them can be unambiguously parsed.

In other words, the metavariable `$($thing:tt)*` (ending with `*`, `+` OR `?`) *must*
be the last fragment in the parser. Since anything can be a token tree, Rust could
not know what to accept after that parser.

To avoid this issue, you can either match a single `tt`, and make the user wrap multiple tokens
inside brackets, or you can specify a delimiter for your match (i.e. `$($thing:tt),+`, since
two token trees not separated by a `,` could not match).

## Restrictions on "Forwarding Macros"

There is one important restriction when calling a macro using another macro.

When forwarding a matched fragment to another macro-by-example, matchers in the
second macro will see an opaque AST of the fragment type. The second macro can't
use literal tokens to match the fragments in the matcher, only a fragment
specifier of the same type. The `ident`, `lifetime`, and `tt` fragment types are an
exception, and *can* be matched by literal tokens. The following illustrates this
restriction:

```rust,ignore
macro_rules! foo {
    ($l:expr) => { bar!($l); }
// ERROR:               ^^ no rules expected this token in macro call
}

macro_rules! bar {
    (3) => {}
}

# fn main() {
foo!(3);
# }
```

The following illustrates how tokens can be directly matched after matching a `tt` fragment:


```rust
// compiles OK
macro_rules! foo {
    ($l:tt) => { bar!($l); }
}

macro_rules! bar {
    (3) => {}
}

# fn main() {
foo!(3);
# }
```

## Exercise 10: Macros Calling Macros

This exercise is similar to the one you completed earlier, building a
`hashmap!` macro; note that there are some subtle differences.

You are being asked to implement two macros: `pair!()`, and `hashmap!()`.
The first should take two expressions separated by a `=>`, and return a tuple of them.
The second should construct an array of those tuples, and use `HashMap::from` to
collect them into a `HashMap`.
